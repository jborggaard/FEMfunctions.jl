function TriMesh_ElementAdjacency(eConn)
#= -------------------------------------------------------------------------78--
 
   Discussion:
 
     TriMesh_ElementAdjacency determines the adjacent elements for each 
     triangular element and for each vertex in a triangular mesh.  This is based 
     on the function TRIANGULARION_TRIANGLE_NEIGHBORS written by John Burkardt.
 
   Usage:
 
     eAdjacency = TriMesh_ElementAdjacency(eConn)
     # planned: eAdjacency,vConn = TriMesh_ElementAdjacency(eConn)
 
     where:
 
     eConn     is the element connectivity.  Standard orientation is assumed
               so the first three nodes in the connectivity are the vertices.
               Dimension: [ nElements, nLocalNodes ]
 
     eAdjacency  is a [ n_elements, 3 ] array which contains the adjacent 
                 element to each triangle edge.  A value of -1 is given if that
                 edge has no adjacent element (e.g., on the boundary)
 
                                 3
                                | \
                         edge 2 |  \ edge 1
                                | e \
                                1----2
                                edge 3
 
 
     #vConn    is a structure of n_node arrays that list elements that are
               connected to each node.  vConn[1].e_list contains a list of the
               elements that include node 1, etc.  (planned)
